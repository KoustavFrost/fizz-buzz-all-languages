# fizz-buzz-all-languages

Fizz buzz is one of the most common programming question. Probably eveyone has solved it atleast once in their life. So I tought of solving it in every programming language possible.

If you do not know what fizz buzz is, then you probably live under a rock. Here is a link you can follow: [Fizz-Buzz](https://wiki.c2.com/?FizzBuzzTest)

In this repo, I am planning to solve the fizz buzz problem in every programming language possible. Like in C, C++, C#, Java, Javascript, Typescript, PHP, Rust, Go, HolyC, Brainf\*ck and the list goes on and on and on.

## How can you contribute?

1. Create a branch from main.
2. Solve the problem in any language you like.
3. Write test cases if needed.
4. Make a PR to me.

Note: Do check which languages have been already solved before.
